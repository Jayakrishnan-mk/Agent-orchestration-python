# Agent Orchestration Flow (Python Assignment).

This is a simple Python implementation simulating a 3-agent orchestration:

- **PRFetcher**: Fetches purchase requests from a mock list.
- **SupplierRecommender**: Suggests suppliers based on the category.
- **RFQCreator**: Generates RFQ objects based on the PR and recommended supplier.

### How to Run

Make sure Python is installed.

```bash
python main.py
Note
The logic is implemented in a basic way as Iâ€™m still learning Python. Happy to improve based on feedback.
